# Wilky the Whale

# API Datasets

Wilky uses various Govhack datasets to power the user-interface (WIP)

# App Portal

A demo instance of the [Wilky user-interface](https://benduncan.github.io/wilky-the-whale-ui/) is intended primarily for a interactive terminal installation not far from the main beach (e.g. town square). The installation will consist of an iPad mounted on a stand, which is accessible to the public to view and see in realtime whale sounds off the coast, and access QLD government and CSIRO data on ocean metrics.

# Hardware Spreadsheet

The info about the various hardware components are collated into a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS0axL6-YYMyzx2jE6wDurdhn4YheI0SrInnZA-kYepqKk4lEPqnQZkQgBLEOZMwNYaRXz1ZH2DWHhn/pubhtml). The hardware for initial prototype will cost about \$350 and will be assembled and tested in the coming weeks.

# Next Steps

Aiming to crowdfund the initial deployment in Peregian Beach, Queensland and deploy the first device August 2019, in time to catch the last month of the whale season. The fixture will be available each whale season, from July through to late October. Additional deployments are scheduled for Noosa and other Sunshine Coast beaches in 2020.
